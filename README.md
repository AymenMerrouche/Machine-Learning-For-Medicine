# Machine-Learning-For-Medicine
Explore the wide applications of Machine Learning algorithms in the medical field.

This repository contains some ML algorithms illustrated on medical datasets (high dimensional, few examples) in a context where not only performances but also interpretation is important. <br>
This work was done as part of the course [**Machine Learning for Medicine**](https://sites.google.com/view/nsokolovska "**Machine Learning for Medicine**") while pursuing a master's degree in machine learning and statistics at Sorbonne University - [**M2 Apprentissage et Algorithmes (M2A)**](https://m2a.lip6.fr/description/ "**M2 Apprentissage et Algorithmes (M2A)**"). <br>
Theoretical considerations, empirical results and analysis are to be found in each notebook.
